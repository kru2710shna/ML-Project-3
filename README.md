# Audio Classification Project Using Deep Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a deep learning model for audio classification, with the goal of accurately categorizing audio data into predefined classes such as genres, speech types, or environmental sounds. The project utilizes a variety of Python packages for data analysis, visualization, and model development.

## Steps

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Explore the audio data thoroughly to understand its characteristics. The following Python packages will be used:

- **Librosa:** A comprehensive Python package for music and audio analysis.
- **IPython.display:** Enhances audio data visualization within Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Matplotlib:** Used for creating figures, graphs, and plots.
- **Scipy:** Provides functions for audio definition and visualization.
- **Pandas, Numpy, sklearn:** Facilitate data manipulation and analysis.
- **Keras, tensorflow:** Frameworks for building and training deep learning models.

### 2. Preprocessing

Prepare the audio data for model training through various preprocessing steps:

- **Feature Extraction:** Utilize Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) for extracting audio features.
- **TQDM:** Visualize progress using TQDM during preprocessing.
- **Label Encoding:** Convert categorical labels into numerical format.
- **Train-Test Split:** Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

### 3. Model Creation

Build a deep learning model using Keras and TensorFlow. The model will be a Sequential neural network with layers such as Dense, Dropout, Activation, Flatten, and various optimizers.

More details will be updated as the project progresses.
