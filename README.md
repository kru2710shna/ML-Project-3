# Audio Classification Project Using Deep Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a deep learning model for audio classification. The aim is to accurately categorize audio data into predefined classes, such as genres, speech types, or environmental sounds. The project utilizes the following Python packages for efficient data analysis, visualization, and model development:

- **Librosa:** A comprehensive Python package for music and audio analysis.
- **IPython.display:** Enhances audio data visualization within Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Matplotlib:** Used for creating figures, graphs, and plots.
- **Scipy:** Provides functions for audio definition and visualization.
- **Pandas:** Enables efficient data manipulation and analysis.
- **Numpy:** Fundamental package for scientific computing.
- **sklearn:** Offers tools for machine learning and data preprocessing.

## Steps

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Explore the audio data to gain insights into its characteristics:

- **Librosa:** Powerful tools for music and audio analysis.
- **IPython.display:** Improves audio data visualization.
- **Matplotlib:** Creates informative figures, graphs, and plots.
- **Scipy:** Supports audio definition and visualization.
- **Pandas, Numpy, sklearn:** Facilitate data manipulation and analysis.

### 2. Preprocessing

Prepare the audio data for model training through various preprocessing steps:

- **Feature Extraction:** Utilize Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) for extracting audio features.
- **TQDM:** Visualize progress using TQDM during preprocessing.
- **Label Encoding:** Convert categorical labels into numerical format.
- **Train-Test Split:** Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

More details will be updated as the project progresses.
