# Audio Classification Project Using Deep Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques to classify audio data into predefined categories. The primary goal is to develop a robust model capable of accurately identifying different audio classes, such as genres, speech types, or environmental sounds. The project utilizes the Librosa Python package for music and audio analysis, along with other relevant packages like IPython.display, Matplotlib, Scipy, and Pandas for effective exploration and visualization of the audio data.

## Steps

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The first step involves thoroughly exploring the audio data to gain insights and understand its characteristics. The following Python packages will be used:

- **Librosa:** A powerful package for music and audio analysis, Librosa provides tools for feature extraction, visualization, and manipulation of audio data.

- **IPython.display:** This package will enhance the visualization of audio data, making it more accessible and understandable within the Jupyter Notebook environment.

- **Matplotlib:** Utilized for creating figures, graphs, and plots, Matplotlib aids in visually representing patterns and trends in the audio data.

- **Scipy:** This package contributes to the project by providing functions for audio definition and additional tools for signal processing and analysis.

- **Pandas:** The Pandas library is employed for efficient data manipulation and analysis, enabling the organization and exploration of audio features.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

The next step involves preparing the audio data for model training. This includes tasks such as feature extraction, normalization, and data augmentation to enhance the quality of the input data.

### 3. Model Development

Deep learning models will be employed for audio classification. This phase will include the design, training, and evaluation of neural networks capable of accurately classifying audio samples.

### 4. Model Evaluation

The developed models will be rigorously evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess their performance and generalization capabilities.

### 5. Model Deployment (Optional)

If applicable, the final trained model can be deployed for real-world applications, such as integrating it into an application or service.
